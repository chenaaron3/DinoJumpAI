# DinoJumpAI
**Unity AI Dino Jump**

Span of Project: 11/26-27/18

**How To Play**
1. Download the .rar file.
2. Run the .exe file.
3. Use arrow keys to speed up/slow down simulation.

**Simulation Background**
  This game simulation was inspired by Google's Steve the Dinosaur minigame. In the build, I present a neural network trained overnight that can successfully dodge up to 400+ obstacles. The possible moves in this game is jump, duck, and stand.

**Script Accomplishments**
 - Created Custom Matrix class, Neural Network class
 - Implemented First Genetic Algorithm (mutation, cross over, repopulate)
 - used low mutation (3%)
 - used single point cross-over (row and col)
 - had 2 parents from given percentage of elites make 1 baby
 - trained overnight to get an AI that can jump and duck
 - save best brain into a JSON
 - load brain into game and see results
